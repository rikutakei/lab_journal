# Personal Lab Journal

My personal lab journal for notes and tips (and also to play around with LaTeX).

## Available features

Currently, there are no useful features available

## Plans and TODOs

### Makefile

Need to create proper makefile to:
1. Compile the LaTeX journal
1. Create a template for notes/tips/journal
  - for journal, create directory for year, month, date, and then a file for the current date
  - for tips, add template and "tags" (if there is such a feature in LaTeX)
1. Pull citations/references from relevant place (ORCID and/or personal bibTeX library somewhere)

### Integrate with Travis

Don't know how to, so this will be fun.
